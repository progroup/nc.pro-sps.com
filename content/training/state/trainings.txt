    Sustainability 3.0 Part 2 with Greg
    Puckett
  description: >
    Whether your coalition has a million
    dollars in the bank or is barely getting
    by on a “shoestring” budget, the
    idea of more funds coming into your
    coalition is an enticing one. Regardless
    of where your coalition services are,
    rural county or the urban core, you,
    too, can be a fundraiser. How, you ask?
    Because coalition fundraising is very
    much about connecting the coalition’s
    mission with the interests of potential
    stakeholder organizations and people and
    then building lasting relationships with
    those stakeholders. Coalition staff and
    members are natural “sellers” to
    convince investors. . This webinar will
    give an overview of the fundamentals of
    fundraising and give insight as to your
    coalition’s readiness for fundraising;
    building an integrated fundraising plan;
    and mobilizing members to implement the
    plan.

    Behavioral Health in Prevention
    Overview...

In this webinar, Ben Gleason will focus on three blue ribbon papers that present a comprehensive view of the field.
