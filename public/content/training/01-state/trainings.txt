  training: NC SUPPORT Data Dashboard
  description: |
    Over the last year, the Community Wellness, Health Integration, and Prevention Section of the Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services has developed the NC SUPPORT data dashboard, with funding from the Partnership For Success project. For this webinar we will share the current and planned NC SUPPORT content and analysis functions.
    
    NC SUPPORT, NC Substance Use Prevention Planning, Outcomes, Risks and Trends, collects administrative data available for all 100 counties in North Carolina, with demographic breakdowns where possible. It provides statewide rankings from 1-100 for all included risk constructs, as well as maps, and trend charts. Users may examine county profiles, compare individual risk constructs across multiple counties, and compare multiple risk constructs within a county. It is intended to be useful for prevention planning and evaluation.
